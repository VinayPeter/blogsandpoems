<h1>The Experiment</h1>
<pr>Yes, it's late. Let's start from Lab, the word "Lab", which I want in Future but private and secret one. The day, which makes people scared, has become my favorite day at school. I didn't tell this to anyone because it's related to strange and craziness. But I can tell this to my friend who is just like me and says 'Amazing', 'Awesome' or 'Fabulous', etc. for this kind of things.

    Yes, so here is what happened...</pr>
<p>This was our 1st practical in 10th class, which was scheduled in the 1st period. This time and first time I ran fast and sat in front and stuck to the table where the teacher performs the experiment. I sat there because in 9th class, a boy was always sitting at that place and the teacher tells him to do the experiment, even the boy never asked to do so. But I got the chance this time due to his compartment.</p>
<p>It was experiment #2, and I had excitement #1.

    Aim :- to study the properties of acids and base
    
    First, it was the turn of acid. Right in front of the eyes, he was doing the procedure on his own.
    
    Part B :- It's turn of the Base
    
    Base :- dil. NaOH
    
    2nd chemical : NaCO3(s)</p>
<p>I have done this experiment at home where a fountain of foam comes out. When added once, the foam fell on the floor in form of drops. The teacher wasn't scared like me. A second spoon of NaCO3 was added to NaOH, but this time above the table. Drops fell down again!! On the table!!</p>

<p>Sir asked, "Is it gone into the eyes?". I replied, "yes, a little drop...". It felt like burning. Mam advised, "Go! Wash your face, quickly!!"

    I wanted to say, "Nothing will happen", but I wasn't able to refuse my knowledge of chemicals and habit of following Teacher's instructions. At that time, a boy poked fun, "Don't worry it's just an acid". Mam scolded that boy. From that time, I started liking the teacher, who follows rules, interrupts at prayer time... my class teacher. I washed my eyes, not the face. I knew, that an already reacted chemical can do nothing.</p>
<p>Most the time or till now, mam always call me Kamal which is very different from my real name. But still, I like her. Also, at the time of attendance, she often reads my name as Rani, the name of one of the girl in my class. But still science is favorite, so science teacher is also favorite</p>
<a>I think it's more than enough, and I hope I get rid of this ear pain....</a>
